## Project Summary

Danger Zone is a web application that allows users to to see a map of Los Angeles and be able to locate where crimes most often occur and what type of crimes occur. Not only that, but there will be a feature to report crimes and add it to the database where it would show up on our website. We will implement features such as an interactive map that has a visualization UI based on whether the crimes commited are recent, how severe the crimes were, and if the location is a crime hot spot. There will also be the ability to filter by specific types of crimes or groups of crimes such as nonviolent and violent, and time ranges that the crimes were committed. We will connect the website with the database such that new database entries are reflected on the webpage. This will allow people to track where new crimes are being committed, and what kinds of crimes they are.
